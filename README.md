# 🔍 Requirements Traceability with Python & NLP

Welcome to your Requirements Engineering mini-lab! In this project, you'll use Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to create traceability links between software requirements and test cases — a key task in software engineering.

---

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

By completing this lab, you will:
- Understand what traceability means in software development.
- Use Python to compare requirements and test cases automatically.
- Apply basic NLP to detect similarities in textual content.
- Visualize how requirement traceability can be automated using a Jupyter notebook or script.
